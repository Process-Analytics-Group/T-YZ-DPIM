# Differentially Private Inductive Miner
    The DPIM is a process discovery algorithm used for process mining. It requires an event log (.CSV or .XES) and a
    nummerical epsilon value for differential privacy as input and creates a differentially private
    Refined Process Structure Tree (RSPT).

## How to get started
    To start, simply run the file DP-Inductive-Miner.py found in Differentially-Private-Inductive-Miner\. You will be
    prompted for the location of an event log file and for an epsilon value.


## Structure of this repository
- ### Event Logs
  - The event logs used throughout the paper can be found in folders \Event-Logs\.
- ### Evaluation Results
  - All data used for evaluation can be found in \Evaluations-Results\[specific metric here]\ with .TXT files for
    various epsilon values.
- ### Aggregated Results
  - An MS Excel file containing all results can be found in \Evaluations-Results\Aggregated Values\DPIM Data.xlsx.
    These are the values our figures are based on.
